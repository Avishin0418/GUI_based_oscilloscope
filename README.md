# GUI-Based Oscilloscope

This project implements a **typical oscilloscope** using an ESP32 microcontroller for signal capture and a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time waveform display.

## ðŸ›  Components

- **Hardware:**  
  - ESP32 (programmed using Arduino IDE)
  - Signal conditioning circuit (if needed, e.g., voltage dividers, amplifiers)
  
- **Software:**  
  - Python GUI (using PySerial for data communication, Matplotlib or PyQtGraph for plotting)

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Real-time analog signal capture  
âœ… Live waveform plotting  
âœ… Adjustable timebase and voltage scaling  
âœ… Basic signal analysis (peak, frequency, RMS)  
âœ… Serial communication between ESP32 and Python app
